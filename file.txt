My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive.
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible.
My father went to prison for her murder.
Then an accident made me the impossible.
To the outside world, I am an ordinary forensic scientist.
But secretly I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me.
And one day, I will find who killed my mother and get justice for my father.
I am the Flash!
